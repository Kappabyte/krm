# KRM
This repository contains various pieces of information and projects related to krm, my own CPU architecture.

## Motivation
I have always been facinated as to how things work. Every time I learn something new, I want to dig deeper and figure out how
it works at a fundamental level. I figured theres no better way to understand how CPUs and computers in general work than to try
and make my own architecture.

## Goals
My hope is to establish the following:

- CPU specfification
    - Instructions
- Emulator
    - Maybe in rust?
    - define memory mapping
    - emulate a gpu and have visual output
- Make it real with an FPGA
- Make a simple game, either in the emulator or on physical FPGA hardware.

This list will probably grow and change as the project continues and I learn more.

## TODO!
This project is still in its early stages. As more is added, this readme will be updated.
